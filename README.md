# DSLauncher
The DSLauncher is the tool used to launch the modified version of Freelancer executable for the Discovery mod.
The launcher supplys a neat interface to specify different launch parameters that affect the in game settings.

# Build
Building the the project is pretty straight forward. The only real requirement is .NET 4.0 which any
Windows 7 machine onwards should have by default. If you have that, it should be as simple as opening the .sln file
in Visual Studio and running 'Build Solution'.

The project requires and assumes you have access to a launcherconfig.xml file that comes with any installation of the
Discovery mod. If you don't have an installation of the mod, grab it [here](https://discoverygc.com/forums/showthread.php?tid=126999).
In addition, the launcher will crash if you don't have the game files within the directory. Place the executable within the root
directory of a Discovery installation.
